Valuing housing prices has seen a surge in popularity over the years amongst policy planners and economist due to the signifcant impact that properties have on the economy and society. The current hedonic pricing models used in the market fails to take into account the effect of local spatial features on the housing prices which however there has been increasing interest and studies carried out on Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, a more precise regression model to stimulate the spatial distribution of housing prices. There are several GWR models available which poses a challenge to casual users who would like to conduct a simple and understandable analysis of the spatial distribution of housing prices. Therefore to address this issue, we developed $patial, an interactive and accessible application with an user friendly interface to aid economists and policy planners to effortlessly explore how variations of spatial features such as number of shopping malls surrounding the housing estate in different locations affects the price of the housing flats.
