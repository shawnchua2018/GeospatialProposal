# Title<br />
$patial - an application to allow users to visualise the effects of spatial autocorrelation between attributes used in determining resale price of flats

# Motivation<br />
Public housing in Singapore is uniquely different, the flats are home to over 80% of the Singapore citizens of which 90% own their own homes. Over the years, policymakers, town planners have placed great emphasis on modelling housing prices as a Housing Development Board (HDB) flat is one of the largest financial commitments for Singapore citizens. Singapore citizens have the choice to purchase either a new Housing Development Board (HDB) flat or a resale flat with less than 99 years left on the lease. The way in which current resale flat prices are determined is largely based on the past transaction price of similar flats in the neighbourhood with price adjustments made to account for differences in flat conditions. However, the pricing model fails to take into account spatial attributes that potentially determine the intrinsic value of the resale flats. <br />

In order to overcome the shortcomings of the current pricing model, geographically weighted regression model, a spatial analysis tool can be incorporated to account for the spatial autocorrelations among the amenities surrounding the resale flats. For our project, we will be constructing a modelling tool based on a geographically weighted regression model to show correlation between spatial attributes and resale flat prices. 

# Objectives<br />
To enable users to analyze and understand the degree of correlation between flat valuation and spatial attributes and how these attributes can affect the predicted resale prices individually or as a whole. Additionally, users may use these models generated to explain certain valuation trends they may encounter.

# Reviews of past projects

**Title:**<br />
EzModel

**Aim of study:** <br />
Explore the impact of spatial variation surrounding resale flats on the resale flat prices 

**Methodology:**<br />
1) Collinearity<br />
2) Global Regression<br /> 
3) Geographically weighted regression (GWR) <br />
4) Mixed (semiparametric) GWR <br />
5) Isoline Map 

**Learning Points:** <br />
1) Using global regression to determine which variables are able to be globally applied to the resulting GWS model calculation in order to obtain a optimal model <br />
2) Making use of isoline mapping to convey information and allow for better analysis 

**Area for improvement:** <br />
Possible to take into account variation of resale price over time

**Title:**<br />
GeoEstate

**Aim of study:**<br />
To educate consumers on the value of property using rigorous statistical methods
 
**Methodology:**<br />
1) Multi-linear regression (MLR)<br />
2) Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)<br />
3) Spatial Autoregression (SAR)

**Learning Points:** <br />
1)Using spatial autoregression it allows us to see how share locational amenities influence neighbouring property prices 

**Area for improvement:** <br />
Could have looked into how the data is aggregated by subzone.
 
**Title:**<br />
Use of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)
Method to Estimate the Effects of Location Attributes on the Residential Property Values

**Aim of study:**<br />
This study estimates the effect of locational attributes on residential property values in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with the use of Geographically weighted regression (GWR). 
 
**Methodology:**<br />
1) Geographically weighted Regression (GWR)<br />
2) Hedonic Pricing Model (HPM)

**Learning Points:** <br />
1) Longitude and latitude coordinates are included in the standard HPM equation such that the weighting of an observation is conducted through a distance decay matrix (Wi), so that observations located near the point in space are weighted more than the observations located further away<br />
2) GWR: Local parameters are estimated rather than global parameters hence providing a way of accommodating the local geography of residential property valueâ€“locational attribute relationship
Each amenities affects the residential property value differently 

**Area for improvement:** <br />
Possibility of mapping both the parameter estimates and t-value together 

# Methodology

1) Regression <br />
For our project, we plan to incorporate many different attributes that may affect one another on different degrees. Therefore, it is important to analyze the relationship between these attributes using regression models to understand how they would affect each other. One key aspect to note in regard to our project is that we would need to ensure lower levels of collinearity between attributes to prevent multicollinearity.

2) Geographically weighted regression model <br />
As compared to simple regression models, GWR takes into account the non-stationary variables such as physical environment features and is able to model the relationship between these features and a target variable. This allows a more complex modelling that considers locality of included features. 
<br /><br />
There are two local weighting schemes that we consider for this project being Gaussian and Bisquare.<br /><br />
For Gaussian weighting scheme, it assigns weights of independent features gradually where the weight decreases as the distance from the target feature increases. In this scheme the weights of independent features will never reach 0 and all inputs are regarded as a neighbouring feature. This would mean that features that are very far from the target feature will have weights that are too small and have almost no impact on regression. However, this scheme helps in avoiding local collinearity by ensuring that all neighbours are assigned a weight and increasing the chance of variation in values. This scheme is better fitted when influence of features are always present and taken into account despite how small it may be.<br /><br />
For the Bisquare weighting scheme, it assigns weights of independent features gradually where the weight decreases as the distance from the target feature increases. However it differs from Gaussian in terms of the weights of further features. In the Bisquare weighting scheme, a maximum distance of neighbouring features is included where features beyond that distance will have a 0 weightage. Therefore, this scheme is better fitted if there is a distance limit that is to be considered.

3) Hedonic pricing model<br />
The hedonic pricing model can be used to determine prices of property based on all attributes taken into consideration. This model is more comprehensive as it is able to determine an estimated price based on given attributes and the degree of how much these attributes actually affect the price, which would mean that differences in the coefficients of individual attributes can give us better distinction in predicted price.
