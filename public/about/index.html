      <p>Valuing housing prices has seen a surge in popularity over
the years amongst policy planners and economist due to the
signifcant impact that properties have on the economy and
society. The current hedonic pricing models used in the
market fails to take into account the effect of local spatial
features on the housing prices which however there has been
increasing interest and studies carried out on Geographically
Weighted Regression (GWR) model, a more precise regres-
sion model to stimulate the spatial distribution of housing
prices. There are several GWR models available which poses
a challenge to casual users who would like to conduct a sim-
ple and understandable analysis of the spatial distribution
of housing prices. Therefore to address this issue, we devel-
oped $patial, an interactive and accessible application with
an user friendly interface to aid economists and policy plan-
ners to effortlessly explore how variations of spatial features
such as number of shopping malls surrounding the housing
estate in different locations affects the price of the housing
flats.</p>
